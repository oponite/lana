# Lana 1.0 Source and Runtime Surface

The mathematics of `STATE`, `STATE_DIST`, `MEASURE`, `TRANSFORM`, and `APPEND`
is defined only by `papers/semantics.md`. This document defines source syntax and
programmer-visible runtime behavior.

## STATE

```lana
state a = state(p: 0.4, d: 0.2);
state b = state(p: 0.4, d_re: 0.1, d_im: -0.3);
```

Exactly one disposition form is required: real-axis `d`, or both `d_re` and
`d_im`. Readable fields are `.p`, `.d_re`, and `.d_im`. The disposition must be
in the closed complex unit disk. `p` must be in `[0,1]`. Runtime expressions are
allowed; materially invalid results raise `SS_ERR_INVALID_STATE`.

The implementation tolerance is `1e-12`. A probability is clamped only within
that tolerance. A disposition whose radius exceeds one only within tolerance is
normalized. Boundary probabilities force both disposition components to zero,
and exposed negative zero is normalized to positive zero.

Optional `timestamp`, `source`, `weight`, and `confidence` fields are metadata.
Construction, assignment, history, and transforms preserve them. States created
by an APPEND sampling kernel have empty metadata because Lana 1.0 defines no
metadata propagation rule for APPEND.

## Distributions and observation

```lana
let dist = append(a, b);
let concrete = sample(dist);
let bernoulli = measure dist;
let probability = measure dist as probability;
let bit = measure dist as sample;
```

`append()` accepts every `STATE`/`STATE_DIST` pair and returns an immutable lazy
`STATE_DIST`. `sample()` accepts only `STATE_DIST`, returns one concrete `STATE`,
and does not mutate the distribution. Measurement accepts a state or distribution
and is read-only. Its default mode is `distribution`; `probability` computes the
exact expected probability recursively, and `sample` draws one classical bit
from that exact Bernoulli mixture.

Unqualified `measure` is the exact computational-basis operation and continues
to compile to `MEASURE_V3`. The computational basis is ordered as
`(|0>, |1>)`, so the returned distribution is always `distribution(1-p, p)`.

### Basis-aware measurement

Concrete states may be measured in one of three named ordered bases:

```lana
let px = measure belief in x as probability;
let dy = measure belief in y as distribution;
let bit = measure belief in x as sample;
```

The basis names and outcome ordering are:

```text
computational = (|0>, |1>)
x             = (|+>, |->)
y             = (|+y>, |-y>)
```

For a concrete `STATE`, all three modes are exact and read-only. A qualified
measurement of `STATE_DIST` supports only `sample`: it samples one concrete
state from the distribution, then performs the selected exact basis
measurement. Qualified `probability` and `distribution` on `STATE_DIST`
return `SS_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_EXACT_MEASUREMENT`; use unqualified measurement for
the existing exact computational-basis expectation.

### Monte Carlo STATE_DIST estimation

Approximate basis-aware expectation is explicit in the source language:

```lana
let p = estimate_measure dist in x as probability with samples: 10000;
let d = estimate_measure dist in y as distribution with samples: 10000;
```

`estimate_measure` accepts only a `STATE_DIST`, and `samples` must be a positive
integer literal. It samples a concrete state `N` times, averages the exact
basis-0 probability of each sampled state, and returns that average (or
`distribution(1-q_hat, q_hat)`). This is a deliberate Monte Carlo
approximation, not the exact mathematical probability and not a hidden runtime
optimization. The VM uses the configured seed and independent samples; larger
sample counts generally reduce error, but no confidence interval is returned.
Zero, negative, non-integer, or non-literal counts, unsupported modes, invalid
bases, and non-`STATE_DIST` inputs are rejected.

Equality compares canonical concrete states by exact binary64 equality of `p`,
`d_re`, and `d_im`. Metadata is not part of state equality. Equality or inequality
involving `STATE_DIST` raises `SS_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`.

## Information and named joints

The first source-level Information forms are lowered to SSBC v5:

```lana
let product = joint independent { x: a, y: b };
let correlated = joint correlated (x, y) with support: [
    [0, 10, 0.25],
    [1, 11, 0.75]
];
let relation = joint conditional { x: a, y: kernel };
let joint_value = rename(product, "x", "subject");
let one_variable = project(joint_value, "subject");
let refined = condition(joint_value, "subject", a);
let sampled_assignment = sample(one_variable);
let definite = resolve(refined); // succeeds only for singleton support
```

Source uses typed joint forms; descriptor strings are rejected. Each correlated
support row contains one value per declared variable followed by a positive
weight, and all row weights must sum to one within `1e-12`. Names are unique
and canonicalized in the runtime. `project` performs exact marginalization and
combines duplicate projected rows; `condition` is pure refinement and reports
`SS_ERR_INVALID_CONDITIONING` for impossible evidence. `sample` is read-only
stochastic evaluation and chooses one complete correlated row. `resolve`
returns `SS_ERR_UNRESOLVED_VALUE` unless the law has singleton support and does
not choose a representative. Conditional nodes declare their supported exact
operations; the initial opaque-kernel form returns `SS_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`
for inference. Unsupported general inference and equality stay explicit errors.
Finite unresolved values and guarded execution are explicit:

```lana
let guard = possibility([true, false]);
let result = 0;
if (guard) { result = 10; } else { result = 20; }
let selected = sample(result);
let refined = observe(correlated, "x", 1);
```

Pure arithmetic, comparison, and function execution map over alternatives while
preserving a shared dependency identifier. An unresolved `if` executes both
branches into guarded environments and joins changed values as a path set.
Unresolved loop guards are rejected. Printing, host calls, task creation, and
observation inside an unresolved branch fail before producing an effect.
`condition` does not record an event; successful `observe` does. Path count is
bounded by the VM and exhaustion returns `SS_ERR_PATH_LIMIT` without exposing a
partial result.

## Native compiler and modules

The production pipeline is `Lana source -> Lana lexer -> fixed-layout typed
syntax -> semantic IR -> textual SSBC -> C assembler/verifier -> C11 VM`. The
compiler sources live in `compiler/`; `compiler/bootstrap/compiler.ssa` is the
reproducible textual bootstrap artifact. A normal build assembles that artifact
with `ssvm` and does not invoke Python.

Imports are relative `.lana` paths and must precede executable syntax. The
native loader canonicalizes paths, rejects cycles and imported-module top-level
statements, deduplicates modules, and resolves local and alias-qualified calls.
Compiler execution uses explicit 256 MiB memory and 50,000,000-instruction
policies; exhaustion is an error and never emits partial bytecode.

## Transforms

```lana
transform target with invert();
transform target with neutralize();
```

The statement replaces `target`. `invert()` maps `(p,d)` to
`(1-p, conjugate(d))`. `neutralize()` maps `(p,d)` to `(p,0)`. Both preserve
metadata and lift lazily over `STATE_DIST` because each registry entry supplies
a concrete rule, validity guarantee, and exact expected-probability rule.

A concrete transform can be deterministic, Borel-measurable, and
validity-preserving yet remain state-only. A distribution lift additionally
requires an exact rule for expected probability. Missing exact support produces
`SS_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`; Lana never substitutes Monte Carlo estimation.

`apply`, `compose`, `collapse`, `reset_d`, and the older transform names are
legacy/non-core and are rejected by the Lana 1.0 source compiler. Their v1/v2
opcodes retain their frozen historical meanings for old bytecode.

## Ordinary language and tasks

Numbers, booleans, strings, null, arrays, functions, control flow, host calls,
history, indexes, CLI commands, and task syntax retain their prior behavior.
Forked tasks own independent VM heaps, budgets, error states, and RNG streams.
Arguments and joined results are deep-copied; shared distribution subgraphs stay
shared inside the receiving VM and are never shared across VMs.
